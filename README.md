# Iris Detection using ResNet152V2 and Convolutional Neural Networks

This project focuses on iris detection using deep learning techniques. The model architecture combines the power of ResNet152V2, a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), with additional convolutional layers to accurately detect and localize iris regions in images.
